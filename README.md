  -Maths challenges, Logical challenges, Chance challenges, Pere Fouras riddles and the Final challenge

Each challenge has mutliple game and a one of each game is chosen when you start a challenge, these are the function:

These are the funtions for the random game : 
  shell_game()<br />
  roll_dice_game()<br />
  chance_challenge()<br />

These are the funtions for the battle ship game : 
  next_player(player)<br />
  empty_grid()<br />
  display_grid(grid, message)<br />
  ask_position()<br />
  initialize()<br />
  turn(player, player_shots_grid, opponent_grid, playerturn)<br />
  has_won(player_shots_grid)<br />
